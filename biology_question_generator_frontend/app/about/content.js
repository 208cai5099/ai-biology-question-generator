This website is designed to be a tool for New York State (NYS) teachers to create practice questions for the NYS 
Life Science: Biology Regents exam. This exam is a new Regents exam that is aligned to the P-12 Science Learning 
Standards for life science. This exam was first implemented in June 2025, and it replaces the old Living Environment 
Regents exam that many people might be familiar with. Because the Life Science: Biology exam is relatively new, 
some teachers need support in preparing their students for the exam. This tool uses large language models to 
generate questions about specific biology concepts from the new learning standards. The goal is to offer an online 
resource to help educators in teaching biology - arguably the best science subject of all!

The NY P-12 Science Learning Standards are a new set of learning standards for science classes from pre-K to grade 12 
in NY public schools. The standards are largely based on the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), a set of 
learning standards published in 2013 that have been increasingly adopted by states nationwide. The design of the NGSS 
was based on three guiding dimensions called Science and Engineering Practices, Disciplinary Core Ideas, and Crosscutting 
Concepts. The philosophy behind the NGSS is that science education should engage students in scientific thinking through 
explorations and investigations of real-world phenomena.

The NY Life Science: Biology exam is a 3-hour assessment with 45 to 55 questions (mix of multiple-choice and open-ended). 
The questions are organized into groups called clusters. Each cluster is anchored on a specific real-world phenomenon. 
Sample cluster questions released by the NY Education Department used coral bleaching and the Devonian extinction as 
the anchoring phenomena. In a cluster, students are expected to interpret multiple stimuli (readings, graphs, 
tables, or images) that are related to the cluster's phenomeon. Students need to apply their biology knowledge, reading comprehension 
abilities, and critical thinking skills to arrive at the answer for each question.

If you are familiar with the Living Environment exam, you would notice that the old exam focuses on recall of 
biology facts and concepts. The Living Environment exam questions are more straightforward, and the answers to 
passage-related questions are often found directly in the passage. In contrast, the Life Science: Biology exam 
requires students to think at a higher cognitive level. Students need to have a firm understanding of foundational 
biology concepts on top of strong reading skills and analytcal skills. They need to connect the information given 
in the readings and other stimuli to determine the correct answers to the questions. Overall, the new exam emphasizes 
less on recall of biology facts and more on scientific reasoning.

Hi there! 

I'm Zhuo, a former math and biology teacher from New York City. In 2019, I graduated with a BA in Biology and began
teaching at charter schools in the city. During my time as a teacher, I was curious about the growing integration 
of technology in everyday life. Driven by my curiosity, I eventually left the teaching 
profession to study computer technology.

Despite transitioning to a different field, I still feel passionate about public education and the need for innovative solutions. 
I heard about the implementation of the new Life Science: Biology exam, and I suspected that many teachers feel 
unsure how to prepare their students for the exam. Inspired by the recent rise of AI-based technology to help teachers design 
their lessons, I made this tool to give NYS teachers a helping hand in preparing their students for the new exam. 
Hope you enjoy using this website!
