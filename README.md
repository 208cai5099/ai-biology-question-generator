# AI Biology Question Generator

## Context
In recent years, the field of science education has been greatly changed by the adoption of new learning standards known as the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Originally released in 2013, the NGSS are built on three dimensions: Science and Engineering Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Disciplinary Core Ideas. New York State is currently implementing new life science learning standards that are largely based on the NGSS. Starting in the 2024 to 2025 school year, high school teachers have to prepare students for a new Life Science: Biology exam that follows the new standards. The state education department has provided exam preparation readings and sample exam questions to help teachers plan their instruction. Yet, some teachers feel confused about the types of questions on the exam despite the available resources provided by the state department. 

This project is designed to support New York State teachers in preparing students for the new Life Science: Biology exam. Using the [crewAI](https://crewai.com) framework and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) LLM service, I have built a web tool that can generate questions that are aligned with the expectations for the new exam. This tool is intended to be one of the many available online resources for teachers. The materials generated by the tool can be further edited. Teachers are encouraged to treat the generated content as a starting point and modify it to meet the learning needs of their students.

## How Do I Access This Tool?
The project is currently deployed online: https://ai-biology-question-generator-6nohin8xv.vercel.app/

In order to use the question generation tool, users need to make an account.

## How Does This Work?
The user has to fill out a form to request the type of questions to be generated. 

1. The user has to pick one of the core ideas from the NY Life Science standards: Structure and Function, Matter and Energy in Organisms and Ecosystems, Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems, Inheritance and Variation of Traits, Natural Selection and Evolution, and Earth's Systems.
2. Based on the core idea selection, the user has to select which skill and knowledge that they want the questions to assess. The menu of available skills and knowledge in the tool are the Level 5 Performance Level Descriptions for the new Life Science: Biology exam. For more info about the levels, click [here](https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/state-assessment/life-science-biology-pld.pdf).
3. The user can optionally provide a real-world biological phenomenon to anchor (or set the context) for the questions. If not provided, the generator will try to pick a phenomenon based on the selected core idea. Why is a phenonmeon needed? The new exam organizes the questions in clusters. Each cluster's questions are designed to revolve around a real-world phenomenon, such as the ongoing coral bleaching or the past Devonian extinction.
4. The user can select the number of multiple-choice and open-ended questions to generate.

The inputs are sent to OpenAI's GPT-4o model. Following a workflow designed using CrewAI, the model will craft a reading about a phenomenon, a table of synthetic data, and a list of question(s). The content will correspond to the inputs provided by the user.

Here is an example reading about the role of glucagon and insulin in controlling blood sugar level:

Here is the synthetic data associated with the reading:

Here is an example question based on the reading and synthetic data:

The user can copy and paste the generated content into their preferred word processor for edits as needed.

## How is this Tool Made?
This tool can be divided into the frontend and backend. The frontend website design and functionality are designed using the Next.js framework for React applications. The UI components are created using the DaisyUI plugin for TailwindCSS. As for the backend, the project uses a cloud-based server hosted on PythonAnywhere. The server has a Flask API endpoint that communicates with the frontend to authenticate users via JWT tokens (tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies that expire after a set time). The account username and password are stored in a SQLite database accessed via SQLAlchemy, and passwords are encrypted using a hashing algorithm via bcrypt. When the Flask application receives a request to generate questions, it calls on multiple tasks that use OpenAI's GPT-4o model to generate the content. The generated content is sent to the frontend as a JSON object.

## Next Steps
The tool can be improved in multple ways. The current workflow takes roughly 30s to 60s to create a set of reading, hypothetical data, and questions. The next iteration of this tool should try to decrease the generation time so that users can receive a faster response time. Furthermore, the authentication and authorization protocol can be improved by incorporating refresh access tokens. This way, users do not have to mannually re-authenticate to access the generation feature. In order to better support teachers, the website can enable the generated content to be available for public view. If implemented, the website will become a growing public repository of exam preparation materials.

## Images
This tool uses the images and icons from [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/), which is an open-source project that provides colorful emojis for public use. Special thanks to the OpenMoji team for creating such fun images.
